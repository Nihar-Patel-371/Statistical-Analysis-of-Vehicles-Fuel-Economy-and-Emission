# Statistical-Analysis-of-Vehicles-Fuel-Economy-and-Emission

The 2024 EPA Vehicle Fuel Economy dataset offers comprehensive records related to vehicle fuel efficiency, and Carbon emissions, along with vehicle related attributes. This study analyzes the dataset to employing rigorous statistical methods, and uncover and identify underlying patterns from vehicle performance to the environmental impact caused by it. Objectives include identifying factors influencing fuel economy and emissions, characterizing distributions across vehicle categories, assessing based on manufacturing vehicle component, and proposing strategies for improved efficiency. The report details data description, pre-processing, descriptive statistics, and inferential analysis, culminating in findings, implications, and future research directions. This analysis contributes to the discourse on vehicular impact on the environment, providing stakeholders with empirical insights for informed decision-making and sustainable practices.
